# Banana Translator
Are you a fan of minions? Did you know that the gibberish they say is an actual language. Use the translator to convert your text from English to Minion speak or Banana language.

## v2.0
-- chnaged code base from vanilla JS to react. but instead of `create-react-app`, used _svelte's_ react version as it 4 times lesser of size from default react app. also with this setup, installation of _vite_ is required.

-- added error handling which is one of the most important thing when dealing with APIs.

-- changed design to web3 inspired modern designs.

## v1.0
-- this is first time I got my hands on with API and data fetching. it prepared me to have an insight about how things work at scale using APIs and external servers.

-- coded using vanilla JS. for styling I used a design (and colors) which pops up to the eye. made the design responsive as well.
